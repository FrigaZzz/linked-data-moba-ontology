# Semantic Web Modeling Project

## Overview

This repository houses the culmination of efforts in creating a conceptual model for the Semantic Web, specifically tailored to the domain of Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games. The motivation behind this project stems from a passion for MOBA games, aiming to enhance player strategy, contribute to game development, and promote advancements in artificial intelligence for gaming.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to develop an ontology that provides a structured understanding of the intricate mechanics inherent in MOBA games. The ontology serves players by elucidating strengths and weaknesses of different in-game elements, aiding strategic decision-making. Additionally, it proves valuable in game development for balancing gameplay and facilitates advancements in artificial intelligence for more sophisticated in-game entities.

## Key Features

- **Object Construction Modeling**: The ontology extensively models the composition and management of object construction, a fundamental aspect of MOBA games. Relationships like "constructed by" and "used to construct" are meticulously defined to capture the intricate process of building objects in these games.

- **Character Modeling**: Special attention is given to representing champion abilities and the concept of evolution. This includes the assignment of evolution points to abilities, reflecting character progression throughout a game.

## Requirements

### Objectives

Given the vastness and complexity of the MOBA gaming domain, the project focused on formalizing a subset of MOBA features. This subset provides a manageable exploration of the domain while capturing essential elements that define MOBA games. The ontology acts as a semi-complete and concise model, offering valuable insights and a structured understanding of this subset of gaming mechanics.

### Specific Tasks and Target Users

#### Specific Tasks:

- **Object Construction**: Understand relationships between different objects and how they combine to form more powerful equipment.
  
- **Character Modeling**: Represent champion abilities and the concept of evolution, including the allocation of evolution points to improve abilities.

- **Game Analysis**: Provide a structured understanding of game mechanics and player performance to help users make informed decisions on improvement.

- **Learning Tool**: Assist novice users in learning the game by providing a structured understanding of game mechanics.

- **Performance Data Visualization**: Create a system for visualizing match information and performance data, akin to MOBAFIRE.

#### Target Users:

- **Beginner Players**: Newcomers to MOBA games seeking a structured understanding of game mechanics to learn the game.

- **Experienced Players**: Those aiming to enhance their gameplay by understanding relationships between different objects and how they combine to form more powerful equipment.

- **Game Developers**: Individuals interested in comprehending relationships and interactions between different elements of the game to balance gameplay.

- **Game Analysts**: Those analyzing gameplay and player performance to provide advice on gameplay improvement.

- **Community Building**: A platform based on the ontology could serve as a hub for the MOBA gaming community, facilitating knowledge sharing and discussions.

## Impact

The adoption of a common ontology in the MOBA gaming community can foster cross-influence between current game developers and aspiring ones. This can be achieved through a shared vocabulary, cross-pollination of ideas, and standardization, potentially leading to innovation within the genre.
