The bonus from Headshot is added after the critical strike is rolled.\nThe full damage of Headshot applies  life steal.\nHeadshot is a single instance of damage, thus does not trigger  Amumu's  Tantrum's or  Warden's Mail's passives twice.\nThe basic attack triggering Headshot can  critically strike, but Headshot's damage remains unchanged if it does.\nSince Caitlyn's Art and Sustainability Update, Ability-granted Headshots are the same as the original Headshot override attack, though what lets them cast at high range is still relatively special. They trigger on-attack effects (including stacking Headshot).\n PENDING FOR TEST:  Runaan's Hurricane's Wind's Fury, is special cased to search targets with the increased range as well.\nBecause Headshot stacks are generated on-attack,  Runaan's Hurricane bolts will not generate stacks towards Headshot.\nThe empowered attack will not trigger against wards.\nStacks will still be generated towards Headshot when attacking them.",

          "notes": "The in-game HUD displays Graves' reload speed in place of his attack speed. This is a visual bug, and his attack speed behaves normally.\nHis reload speed is in the form of reloads per second:\nGraves' bonus attack speed growth and the cap affect his reload speed, making his bonus attack speed more worth after each level.\nReload speed: Scales less the more attack speed you have until 150% bonus attack speed (not included growth). Going over that will decrease the reload speed until capping at 200% bonus attack speed.\nThe reload time after firing both shells and the time before the reloading starts while sitting on one shell are the same, of 2.08 seconds. They're then reduced by bonus attack speed, to a minimum of 1.54 \u2212 1.12 (based on level) seconds.\nReload speed at 150% bonus attack speed: 0.651 \u2212 0.891 (based on level).\nThe reload time with one shell is 1.3 seconds.\nGraves' attack windup is based on such a low value that it will always take only 1 game tick, even at the lowest possible  attack speed (0.2AS).\nWhen Graves' has his range increased by 35% to  573.75 via  Rapid Firecannon, it has special effects on his cone spread:\nThe reach of the individual missiles is also increased by 35% to  843.75 /  783.75.\nThe spread of the individual missiles is decreased by 35% (angle  \u00d7  1/1.35) to 17.7\u00b0 / 22.2\u00b0.\nThe reduced spread means that the empowered attack can deal adequate damage in a scaled-up cone.\nGiven the right circumstances pellets can fly past and beyond the intended target without colliding with them, and thus collide with other enemies.\nBecause the first pellet to hit an enemy deals unreduced damage, this can increase the total damage of the attack dealt, but spread across more targets instead.\nIf Graves is  blinded pellets will fly (still in a cone) in a random direction (excluding his target's) but he can still damage nearby enemy units hit by pellets.\nStructures will intercept and can be hit by multiple pellets, as with other valid targets.\n Wards and Jungle plants will not intercept pellets, and instead be triggered by a hiden homing attack missile (3000 missile speed, 3400 on crit), reminiscent of the more standard ranged attack of pre-rework  Graves.\nGraves will not collaterally damage wards or jungle plants, and blocking pellets from reaching the target ward or jungle plant will not prevent Graves from damaging them.\nThe first pellet to hit an enemy deals  basic damage, additional ones to hit the same enemy from the same attack deal  default damage.\nBecause of this, only the first pellet to hit each enemy applies on-hit effects (see further details below).\nThe additional pellets still apply life steal.\n Warden's Mail only reduces damage from the first pellet to hit its wearer.\n PENDING FOR TEST:  Randuin's Omen's damage reduction to critical damage will apply to the damage of each pellet from a critical buckshot.\nAttack effects have a variety of interactions with New Destiny:\n On-hit effects are dealt to each stuck target, but not multiple times to the same target by subsequent pellets from the same attack.\nThe order is based on the order in which the targets are hit. \"Single-use\" on-hit effects (e.g.  Spellblade) will be applied to the first enemy hit; the closest one.\nOn-Action Effects such as  Help, Pix! and  Runaan's Hurricane will be triggered, and still obey their standard target-acquisition rules. Wind's Fury can select secondary targets that will also be damaged by collision from Graves' attack.\n Energized is special and will be applied by a hidden homing attack missile (3000 missile speed, 3400 on crit), reminiscent of the more standard ranged attack of pre-rework  Graves. The effect is therefore guaranteed to affect his attack target.\n Black Cleaver triggers on every instance of physical damage, so it will apply 1 stack when each individual pellet hits, stacking multiple times if multiple pellets hit the same target (Armor reduction does not take effect until the automatic stat update).",

The Spirit's allies cannot manually select it as a valid target for spells and abilities, but they can still do so with automatically targetted effects. (bug)\nSpirits take 50% damage from turrets and do not cause turrets to  Warm Up their attacks. (bug)\nSpirits cannot be  healed nor  shielded ( Summon Aery excluded (bug)).\nThe Spirit levels up when the Vessel does, gaining the target's stats per level. If the target has a resource that also increases per level (i.e  mana), the Spirit's lifetime will increase instead. (bug)\nThe Spirit's destination is decided based on Illaoi's position and facing direction when the target is hit.\nThe Spirit is  untargetable while it is being pulled, and spawns with the tethered champion's default model and size.\nThe Spirit's lifetime is sometimes 0.25 seconds longer, while its untargetability is sometimes shorter, causing Tentacles to hit an inconsistent amount of times.\nRedirected damage is calculated by taking the pre-mitigation damage against the Spirit, applying Test of Spirit's damage modifier, and then capping it to the Spirit's current health. This damage will then be affected by damage modifiers (resistances and other effects) of the Vessel.\nThis order of operations allows Test of Spirit to deal more or less percentage of the Vessel's health than would be expected:\nBecause the Spirit's modifiers can be different from the Vessel's, and the damage being pre-mitigated, allowing the Spirit to have higher or lower effective health, respectively increasing or decreasing the maximum achievable damage from killing it.\nBecause the cap is supposed to block excess damage over the Spirit's current health, which does not reliably do so or does too well, depending on whether the Spirit's damage modifier is higher than Test of Spirit's or not, respectively. This causes an increasing difference of damage when the pre-mitigated damage is between Spirit current health \u00f7 Spiritmod and Spirit current health \u00f7 Emod. (bug)\nTo fix this case, pre-mitigated damage would need to be capped at the amount that kills the Spirit, and only then have Test of Spirit's damage modifier apply.\nIllaoi needs 937.5 / 875 / 812.5 / 750 / 687.5 total AD to reach 100% redirected damage. As per above, the damage is still dependent on the Spirit's and Vessel's damage modifiers and may not always be able to deal 100% of the target's current health as total redirected damage.\n Spell shields may only prevent the initial spirit grab and the slow upon becoming a Vessel. Spell shields will not prevent becoming a Vessel or Tentacles from attacking.\nThe tendril can be blocked by abilities such as  Yasuo's  Wind Wall, but the returning tether slow cannot, even if it can otherwise be  destroyed by effects that can do so (i.e  untargetability).\nThe tether slow will not be fired if the target is already  untargetable when the Spirit dies.\nThe spirit pull is not considered a  crowd control effect and will not be blocked by  crowd control immunity, with the exception of  Morgana's  Black Shield.(bug)\nThe projectile tentacle model is linked to Illaoi's model animation and size. However gameplay wise it is not, thus the actual hitbox being different than the position, width and length of the visible model. (bug)\nThe model will stop mid-air / vanish if Illaoi goes into  stasis,  sleep or  airborne, however the actual hitbox will continue its trajectory unseen.\n PENDING FOR TEST: The projectile is however seen by enemies if Illaoi is not  visible.\nThis ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.\nAnd will fire towards the same pointed location.\nGrabbing the Spirit of a champion before it goes into  resurrection via  Chronoshift or  Guardian Angel will spawn the Spirit with 0 health, making it  invulnerable. (bug)\nThe same does not happen with other resurrection effects (i.e  Karthus'  Death Defied) since they leave the champion with more than 0 health.\nGrabbing the Spirit of a champion with  Flow or  Ferocity will make the Spirit's lifetime (the white bar below the lifebar) disappear. (bug)\n PENDING FOR TEST: Grabbing the Spirit of an  Oathsworn will make the Spirit invisible. (bug)\nIllaoi is the only one able to see who's been Vesseled, by adding a layer of watery effects on their model. The Vessel will also be let known it's debuffed, by having a layer of watery effects on its screen instead.\nIf the target becomes a Vessel while  vanished, the layer on their model will fail to be added. (bug)\nThe Vessel status effect is a debuff that doesn't persist through death.\nIf the target is made a Vessel while  resurrecting, they will not revive as a Vessel.\nRunes consider the Spirit as a champion for their effects and stat-tracking. (bug)\nTentacles damage with  First Strike only reflects double bonus damage, not taking into account actual damage done to the Spirit (e.g if  First Strike would deal 3 bonus damage, what would get reflected is 6 damage). (bug)\nTransferred damage will apply on-damage effects, such as  Black Cleaver,  Morellonomicon,  Executioner's Calling,  Riftmaker,  Aspect of the Dragon burn damage.\nRedirected damage always counts as single target for the purpose of  Omnivamp.\nThe Spirit will also redirect the bonus damage dealt by Riftmaker and Aspect of the Dragon, effectively double diping their damage to the Vessel. In particular, Riftmaker also further increases its own redirected damage, granting an additional 0.81% bonus damage at full stacks, for a total of 18.81%.\nTransferred damage will not doubly apply on-hit or on-spell effects versus the target (e.g.  Liandry's Anguish,  Phase Rush stacks). These effects are only applied versus the Spirit.\nAttacking the Vessel and its Spirit simultaneously will only apply one stack of  Black Cleaver to the Vessel. (bug)\nWhen the tether is broken (whether the Spirit's lifetime ran out or the target moved out of range), the Spirit will  vanish and move to Illaoi's location.\nAn  uncancellable windup attack may still kill the Spirit after it vanished to grant the gold, but without making the target a Vessel.\nThe Spirit is immune to  stasis (i.e.  Bard's  Tempered Fate).\n Fiora's  Riposte can be used to prevent becoming a Vessel if used before the Spirit is killed or while leaving the tether's range.\n Sion's Spirit cannot be spawned during  Glory in Death. Spirits created before Sion's  zombie state will remain active.\nIf the target that had its Spirit pulled from them is taken into the  Realm of Death, the tether will break, but they will not be made into a Vessel.\nIf Illaoi has  Crown of the Shattered Queen's Safeguard, the Spirit will gain Safeguard's effects.(bug)\nThe following table refers for interactions while Illaoi is firing the projectile and while the target's Spirit is being pulled:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Tentacle Smash and  Leap of Faith are buffered.

If  200 acquired afterwards, the next stack will grant  8%. The two increased attack speed by  14% (6 + 8) and not  16% (8 + 8).\nArisen\n\nBasic attacks within  175 will still use Kayle's melee basic attack animations and do not utilize  projectiles.\nThey are still classified as  ranged attacks.\nDue to this fact, projectile blocking effects cannot intercept basic attacks while Kayle's target is within her \"melee\" range.\nAflame\n\nOn becoming Aflame, Kayle's bonus size grows linearily over 1 second.\nBasic attacks against structures and wards do not trigger fire waves.\nWhile at 4 stacks of  Zeal, the next on-attack reaching the fifth stack will be empowered by Aflame, releasing the first fire wave.\nTranscendent\n\n Zeal and  Exalted buffs swapped to a new buff that grants the benefit of both and it is not visible on Kayle's HUD.\nThis buff also updates its attack speed value whenever a stat update happens and ability power is changed, however, it does not track ability power from other buffs, unless they have been specifically special cased. The following buffs are not special cased yet and will not grant bonus attack speed:\nRunes (including  Adaptive Force rune shards )\n Infernal Might\n Yuumi's  You and Me!\nFire Waves Details\n\n     Hitboxes shows by a graph side by side.   A wave consists of three projectiles for the hitbox and a fourth for visuals.\nThe hitbox projectiles spawn 75 units behind Kayle, travel through her, and are destroyed once they've traveled 850 units. Their technical details are:\nRange:  850 (755 effective)\nWidth:  200\nProjectile Speed: 2800\nAngle: 18\u00b0 (left and right at 9\u00b0 to their side, respectively)\n Projectile blocking effects can block each projectile individually.\nIt is possible to block the visuals, but still get hit by an unblocked \"invisible\" hitbox projectile.\nHitting an enemy with multiple projectiles of the same wave will not increase the damage dealt.\nThe fire wave shares cast instance with the triggering basic attack.\nThe amount of  Conqueror stacks gained will be ( 2 /  1) if the basic attack deals damage first or 2 if the wave does so.\nKeep in mind that it's still two damage instances. If one triggers  Bone Plating, the other's damage will be blocked.\nFire waves roll  critical strike chance on each target hit individually.\nThe distance of the fire waves scales with bonus attack range.\nA known issue is that despite dealing  area spell damage the fire wave does not:\nconsume Mana Charge from  Tear of the Goddess and its upgrades,\nor trigger  Manaflow Band.\nInteractions & Other\n\nBecause Kayle is both a  melee and  ranged champion, she can purchase both ranged and melee exclusive items at anytime, but their effects will function depending on her current range type; the same principle also applies to runes.\nHowever, keep in mind that, prior to ascending to Arisen,  Starfire Spellblade also changes this behaviour based on its usage.\nWaves are fired in the direction that Kayle is facing. Changing that during the attack windup via  Flash will also change the direction of the wave.\nEach ascension has an unique animation and a voice line. (See: Kayle's quotes)\nThe ascensions' animation will override the current one, but it does not cancel Kayle's current action, nor her previous orders.",

          "notes": "Details\nThis ability has a cast time and cast delay. The former represents the amount of time Kayle needs to spend to cast and is equal to her attack windup time. The latter is the amount of time the portal needs to launch the sword, which is always 0.264 seconds seconds, starting from the beginning of the cast time.\nAs implied by the previous point, the portal is created at the start of the cast time and Kayle does not have to be alive for it to launch the sword.\nThe portal does not follow Kayle's movements, using  Flash or getting displaced won't change its position nor direction either.\nThe cast time can be calculated by dividing Kayle's windup percent value (0.193555) with her current total attack speed.\nRadiant Blast's cast time is 0.33 seconds at base attack speed, is at most 0.99 seconds at the minimum attack speed of  0.2, and is 0.099 seconds at the attack speed cap of  2.5. The cast time can be further decreased with effects that allows the player to bypass the attack speed cap, such as  Lethal Tempo,\nAdditionally, it should be noted that due to action only taking place on whole game ticks, the cast time can only be changed in fractions of 0.033 seconds. This also means that the lowest possible cast time is 0.033 seconds, requiring at least  5.8652 attack speed.\nCorrection: Important to note that in patch V9.17, Radiant Blast's cast time was changed to be a flat 0.25 seconds, rather than scaling with the attack windup time. In patch V10.4, this was undocumentedly changed back. Whether the change to scale with windup time again was intentional or not is unknown.\nThe resistance reduction is applied after the damage has been dealt.\nThe expansion consist of 5 hitboxes, forming a cross-like shape centered 100 units ahead from the impact in its direction. Their technical details can be seen below and visualized on the image to the right.      The left side shows projectile's width and the total area traveled if it does not hit a target, while the right side shows the explosions when it hits a target.  \nExplosionCenter: 100 radius\nExplosionLeft: 150 distance, 125 width\nExplosionRight: 150 distance, 125 width\nExplosionBackward: 100 distance, 90 width\nExplosionForward: 400 distance, 90 width\nInteractions & Other\n\nThe visual effects of the explosion shows the blade and guard of Kayle's swords.\nThe resistance reduction can be tracked on the HUD as a debuff called Sundered and has a special icon that can be seen below.\nCorrection: Note that the  PsyOps skin still uses the old shred VFX, which also only shows for 3 seconds (effect duration is not affected). This is possibly an oversight as all existing, and at the time released Dragon Slayer, skins were updated properly in V11.18.\nhttps://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/File:Celestine_Wish_Kayle_PsyOps_Shred_Indicator_Issue.mp4",

          "notes": "Details\nStarfire Spellblade will be buffered and cast when the cooldown ends if the player attempts to cast it within 0.1 seconds of the cooldown ending.\nStarfire Spellblade consist of 3 parts, each dealing different type of damage source type:\nThe basic attack part deals  basic.\nThe passive's on-hit effect deals  proc.\nThe active's portion deals  spell.\nAdditionally, the damage against secondary targets caught in the explosion is also tagged as area of effect.\nThe basic attack and the active's portion shares the same cast instance since patch V11.1. (Exception:  Muramana, see under Interactions & Other.)\nParry interactions:\n Blind: The main target will never receive damage, but the secondary targets will receive the active's spell damage.\n Block: Blocking will always negate all damage. Keep in mind that if a secondary target is outside of  Spirit's Refuge's zone, they won't block damage.\n Dodge: Dodging will always negate all damage.\n PENDING FOR TEST:: All parry interactions are marked for retesting because of patch V11.1 changes.\nInteractions & Other\n\nWhile the active's effect is up, a circle is visible to Kayle, indicating her  range, however, this circle only takes into account  Divine Ascent's effect on her range, not other sources such as  Rapid Firecannon.\nThe increased range (with the item's effect included) will be  675 prior to ascending to Transcendent, after which it's  725.\nTo clarify the description, Starfire Spellblade can behave both as a  ranged and  melee attack based on how far the target is prior to Kayle ascending to  Arisen, after which the attack will be always using ranged standards.\nIf the target is 200 units away or closer, the attack will be considered melee. This also uses her melee animations, not utilizing projectiles even after ascending.\nIf the target is over 200 units, the attack will be considered ranged.\nTo further expand on this: Using the ranged empowered attack will change Kayle's range type to ranged while the projectile is alive. This means that if the target could outrun the projectile, Kayle would be stuck on being ranged, although the bonuses from the active are not kept. While it's unlikely to be on this temporary ranged state for longer than half a seconds during a normal playthrough, it is possible to achieve few seconds when specific conditions are met.\nKeep in mind that while on-hit effects will be applied to all targets in the explision, on-attack effects are only applied once per basic attack, not per target hit.\nSingle-use on-hits, such as  Spellblade, will be applied to the main target.\nIf the main target died prior to the projectile reaching them, or if it was a jungle plant, the effects will be applied to the closest target from the explosion's center.\n Guinsoo's Rageblade's Phantom Hit can only be applied to the main target.\nDespite being one cast instance, Starfire Spellblade triggers  Muramana's Shock twice on each target, dealing normal bonus damage after the basic attack and increased bonus damage after the spell, totalling at ( 5% /  4.2%) maximum mana (+ 6% AD) bonus physical damage.",

This means that if Kayle's and an ally's selection ranges are intercepting each other on the cursor's position, the cast will always occur on the ally.\nAs implied by the description, the invulnerability is granted at the beginning of the 1.5 seconds cast time, while the damage is dealt at the end.\nNote that the cast time and the invulnerability duration is independent from each other. Some players may confuse the cast finish as the end of the invulnerability, but the target will be still invulnerable for 0.5 / 0.75 / 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 more seconds.\nPrior to becoming Transcended via  Divine Ascent, casting Divine Judgment refreshes the duration of  Zeal stacks at the start of the cast time to ensure that it does not expire while she can't attack during the cast.\nDuring cast, an indicator for the damaging area can be seen around the target, however, this is not visible if there is no  sight on the them.\nDivine Judgment can be cast on  clones too, including  Shapesplitter and  Warrior Trickster, which are normally not targetable for allies.\nWhile it's uncommon occurence, it is possible to cast Divine Judgment on targets who just entered  resurrection or  zombie state. This is only possible with very strict timing and perhaps high latency.\nIt's recommended to avoid both of the afformentioned interactions, as they renders the usage of Divine Judgment useless in many cases.\nInteractions & Other\n\nWhile the target is invulnerable, a number indicator will appear beneath them whenever they would receive damage to show the amount that was entirely mitigated. This is calculated pre-mitigation, or before resistances and reductions are taken into account.\n Rapid Firecannon's Energized effect behaves strangely with the set basic attack range:\nIf the ability is cast while the effect is ready, the range goes from  400 to  385 over 4 stat updates (400 -> 390 -> 387 -> 385). When the cast completes, the proper range needs 2 updates to set in ( 660 -  675 while Arisen;  710 -  725 while Transcended).\nGaining the effect during the cast will cause the range to cycle between  525 and  550 until the cast finishes, then the proper range is set after 1 update.\nSelling the item during the cast causes the range to be set to  250.\n PENDING FOR TEST: Range values are outdated because of patch V11.18 changes to Kayle.\n\nThe invulnerability can be tracked on the HUD via a buff called  Intervention.",

Champions are only affected by their boundaries and are not able to see the others.\n Tahm Kench's  Devour can carry a target outside of their circle, but they will be displaced back inside once  Regurgitated.\nAn active  Cease and Desist on a target outside the perimeter will cause  Vi to continue her charge until her circle ends. She can knock back and damage secondary targets multiple times.\nStructures exist in all realms at the same time.  Turrets will behave normally as if all units were in the same realm.\nHex-gates on  Hextech Rift will not be present between realms.\n Brushes will maintain their presence between realms.\nSwitching realms detaches all  attached champions on either of the two champions entering the realm.\n Kayn's  Umbral Trespass will cause him to detach immediately when Realm of Death ends.\nThe allied health, resource, and ultimate indicators (champion portraits located on the screen) will not update between realms as the players have no  vision of them.\n Camille's  The Hextech Ultimatum, catching  Draven's  Spinning Axe,  Ekko's  Timewinder and  Parallel Convergence,  Malzahar's  Null Zone,  Maokai's  Twisted Advance,  Lulu's  Pix,  Pyke's  Death from Below,  Taliyah's  Worked Grounds,  Viktor's  Gravity Field,  Ziggs'  Satchel Charge, and  Rift Scuttler's  Speed Shrine are exceptions and may still take effect between dimensions if the conditions are valid.\nEffects such as  Requiem,  Absolute Zero,  Grand Starfall and  Final Spark will only deal damage to enemies of the dimension they're in at time of cast. Ending the channel or cast time while inside another dimension will not do damage to nearby enemies.\nAny spawned terrain while in the Death Realm will remain inside until expired. They will not be destroyed.\n Akali's  Shuriken Flip can be recast even if the target is in another realm.\n Kindred's  Lamb's Respite is one of many area of effect abilities that will not take presence between realms.\n Malzahar's  Void Shift dispels from the initial cast's  slow, thus not being able to resist the Realm of Death with its crowd control immunity.(bug)\n Nocturne's  Paranoia only applies  nearsight to enemy champions in the same dimension as him.\n Orianna's  Ball will snap back to her the moment she switches realms.\nThe target of  Devour will immediately leave  Tahm Kench's belly when he enters or leaves the Realm of Death.\n Taliyah's  Weaver's Wall is interrupted both for if she enters or leaves the Realm of Death.\n Urgot's  Fear Beyond Death cannot be recast while the target is in a different dimension than him. If the target is being reeled in however, then the execution at the end of the channel will take place regardless of the dimension either he or the target is in.\nThe fear upon a successful execution will occur in  Urgot's realm.\n Viego's  Mist Wraiths will spawn between realms.  Harrowed Path will also take presence between realms.\n Xayah's  Bladecaller cannot call  Feathers between dimensions.\n Zed's  Shadows will take presence between realms.\n Eye of the Herald and  Teleport are disabled while in the Realm of Death.\nControllable pets and decoys can still be commanded between realms.\nJungle plants ( Blast Cone,  Honeyfruit,  Scryer's Bloom) will not take presence between realms.\n\n\nType\n\nCast time\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\n Shurelya's Battlesong  Turbo Chemtank  Youmuu's Ghostblade  Gargoyle Stoneplate  Randuin's Omen\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll the other item-actives are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite  Flash\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath, unless protected by  Resurrection",

The following do not consume Brittle but benefit from the reduction:  blinds,  cripples,  disarms,  grounding,  silences, and  slows.\nCrowd control effects that are unaffected by Tenacity do not benefit from the reduction at all, which are  airborne,  drowsy,  nearsight,  stasis, and  suppression.\nAlthough  airborne effects won't last 30% longer, if the spell simultaneously  stuns the target, this stun will be extended and persist past the airborne duration, for an overall increased crowd control duration.\n Ornn's  Searing Charge and  Call of the Forge God each apply both airborne and stun simultaneously for the same duration for this reason.\nLiving Forge's increase in bonus health  stacks multiplicatively with  Vigilant Wardstone's Blessing of Ixtal.\nIt is not required to rank  Bellows Breath in order to apply Brittle.\nThe bonus magic damage inflicted by Brittle is credited to Ornn.\nThe magic damage benefits from Ornn's  magic penetration.\nMastercraft items and their components are not the same item and so in theory any unnamed passives would stack and any unnamed actives would only put themselves on cooldown upon activated. This is however not true. Actives will always place their counterpart on cooldown.\nIf Ornn buys another mythic item after he has reached level 13, selling it will grant no gold.(bug)\nThis will persist even if he purchases the initial item again.\nIf Ornn has one of his Mythic item's components in the first item slot, in addition to his completed Mythic item in any other slot, the component will vanish upon upgrading the Mythic item.(bug)\nThis does not occur upon upgrading an ally's item.\n PENDING FOR TEST::  Spell shield interaction with Ornn's empowered attack against  Brittle targets.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Ornn is  channeling:\nAll of Ornn's actions are disabled during the first 0.5 seconds of the channel.\n\n\nType\n\nChannel\n\n\nAttacking\n\nInterrupts\n\n\nAbilities\n\nInterrupts\n\n\nMovement\n\nInterrupts\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Hextech Rocketbelt\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nAll item-actives not specified above interrupt\n\n\nConsumables\n\nInterrupts\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite  Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash  Mark  Dash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDamaging effectsDeath Cast-inhibiting effects\n\nThe following table shows a list of all Masterwork items and the additional stats they provide compared to their non-upgraded version, as well as the gold value of these stats: (edit)\nLua error in Module:ItemData at line 694: attempt to perform arithmetic on a string value.",

If the empowered attack had already gone off, the knock up will not be resisted, thus interrupting the target's actions.(bug)\nIt will trigger against  crowd control immune targets.\nThe knock up will however be partially resisted against  Black Shield; only the disabling portion (airborne debuff) will be negated but not the displacement (forced movement).(bug)\nThe knock up will be resisted by  Riposte, but the ability does not trigger its on- immobilization effect.(bug)\nThe empowered attack will not apply the knock up against  suspended enemies.\nThe empowered attack will only apply the knock up if the target is still  immobilized or  airborne upon being hit. It will not apply if they are no longer disabled when hit.\nThe empowered attack cannot be used against a target with a  spell shield.\nThe application of the knock up can occur on any of the missiles of the empowered attack if it had not already occurred on the first missile.\nA missile that is parried by  Riposte or is  dodged,  blocked, or missed while Samira is  blinded cannot apply the knock up.\nWhile  grounded or  rooted, Samira cannot  dash into range to use the empowered attack. She can only use it if her target is within her  attack range while under this condition.\nThe on-target cooldown will apply even if the empowered attack is parried.\nThe empowered attack rolls  critical strike for each shot of the flurry.\nThe bonus magic damage dealt with the blade is  default damage. The empowered attack is first 1 instance of  basic damage and then 5 instances of  default damage.\nThe attacks do not deal the bonus damage against structures.\nThe empowered attack is unaffected by  attack speed modifiers.\n Guinsoo's Rageblade's Phantom Hit and  Runaan's Hurricane's bolts will not apply the bonus magic damage, since it is a hit effect of specifically the melee attack casts.\nAttacks with the gun and blade do not count as different attacks for stacking Style.\nBasic attacks using the blade are still classified as  ranged.\nThe melee attack's range condition is unaffected by  attack range modifiers (e.g.  Rapid Firecannon).\nBlade range is calculated edge-to-edge just like basic attack ranges are, hence both Samira gaining bonus size or her target increases the total distance at which Samira can attack them with the blade.\nSince the  knock up requires an exterior source to  immobilize the enemy,  Aftershock will be swapped with  Grasp of the Undying for Samira at the start of the game.\nSince  Inferno Trigger's cooldown is static,  Ultimate Hunter will be swapped with  Treasure Hunter for Samira at the start of the game.\nAbilities blocked by  spell shields will still grant Samira Style stacks.\nSamira still gains Style stacks from damaging attacks and abilities landed against  clones.",

This matters for effects that are consumed on-hit (e.g.  Duskblade of Draktharr,  Spellblade), which are applied to the target with the lowest Spawn ID.\n\"Spawn ID\" is an unofficial abbreviation to describe the spawn order for all units at the beginning of games, below are some examples.\nIf Senna targets an enemy champion but hits at least one more enemy champion simultaneously,  Press the Attack's first stack will be applied to that target. If no champion was targeted, it will default to the champion with the lowest Spawn ID out of the ones struck by the ability. Whether the effect stacks up on a champion or not when multiple enemy champions are stuck also depends on Spawn ID.\nIf Piercing Darkness struck an enemy champion and turret simultaneously, with  Rapid Firecannon fully charged, the passive effect will most likely proc on the turret since towers are often spawned before champions.\nFor on-attack effects, they are also applied in order of struck units' spawn IDs. However, there are some specific on-attack effects that will apply to both the target of Piercing Darkness and the target with the lowest Spawn ID if the two unit is not identical. (bug) Confirmed cases:\nEnergized effects are stacked 2 stacks\nSpectral Waltz are granted 2 stacks\n PENDING FOR TEST:\n Spell shield will not prevent on-hit effects from being applied.\n PENDING FOR TEST:: Piercing Darkness interaction with  dodging,  blocking, and  blinding effects.",

The wraith model does not distinguish which champion is obscured.\nOn the mini-map, obscured champions will be displayed as wraith icons instead of champion icons to the enemy team.\nIn-game, the 'Cloak of Mist' buff grants camouflage and the 'Wraith Form' buff obscures the unit and grants movement speed. However, 'Cloak of Mist' has the unspecified effect of negating the obscuring effects of 'Wraith Form' (i.e. the unit is not a wraith while inside the mist); the unit has the bonus movement speed even when they are not a wraith (e.g. inside the mist or an enemy is nearby); and 'Wraith Form' also grants the functionality of camouflage (i.e. the unit is treated as a camouflaged unit with regards to  True Sight,  Control Wards, and enemy  champions).\nGiven this overly complex interaction between the two buffs granted as well as the overlapping effects, it is easier to describe the effects as a single buff that is modified in specific circumstances rather than trying to establish a new game mechanic.\nSenna likewise has her aura buff and the 'Wraith Form' buff, but her 'Wraith Form' does not share gameplay functionality with other allies benefiting from Wraith Form. For Senna, the appearance of being a wraith is a form-swap while camouflaged (similar to  Evelynn's  Demon Shade). Senna will remain in her wraith form when she is detected so long as the camouflage effect isn't broken, and her wraith's appearance is very distinct from other wraiths.\nAllied champions who enter the mist and have  stealth of their own will still gain the Wraith Form buff but they will not grant  obscured vision of themselves to the enemy while out of the mist nor will they appear as a Wraith.\nAllies who have their own  camouflage and also have Wraith Form will be revealed to enemies from their stealth's detection range, not Wraith Form's.\nCurse of the Black Mist will not activate if Senna enters  resurrection during the cast time.\nWraith Form will not be granted to allies that are in a  zombie state or are  channeling. It will be granted to allies even if they are  untargetable.",

When it ends, he instantly revives. This may result in some odd interactions and bugs at times.\nThe effect that heals Sion back to full health at the start of Glory in Death cannot be modified by  healing reductions and does not count towards the 'Damage Healed' statistic at the end of game lobby.\nThe health loss is unaffected by  Invulnerability.\nGlory in Death has a capped 60 seconds duration. If the player manages to survive for so long, Sion dies instantly, regardless of his current health.\nThe healing modifier during Glory in Death reduces all incoming healing, it does not matter if they are sourced from Sion himself or an ally. This does not affect life steal.\nThis healing modifier stacks additively with  Spirit Visage and does not stack with heal and shield power.\nThis means that purchasing Spirit Visage enables Sion to have regeneration and use healing effects at 25% effectiveness, and the life steal gained will be increased to 125% as expected.\nThe fixed attack speed is achieved by lowering and increasing the maximum and minimum attack speed to  1.75, respectively.\nThis also means that it's unaffected by other attack speed modifiers for the duration, such as bonus attack speed or  cripples.\nHowever,  Hail of Blades, which allows for the normal attack speed cap ( 2.5) to be surpassed, will also break this limit. This means that while it is active, Sion may exceed his  1.75 cap, but cannot fall below it.\nThis does not apply to  Lethal Tempo.\nWhen  Hail of Blades ends, the attack speed cap will revert to  2.5 and not to  1.75, however Sion still can't fall below  1.75.\nSome item passives do not persist through death and will be lost for the initial few seconds of Glory in Death.\nThe bonus on-hit damage granted by Glory in Death is unaffected by life steal, but is applied against structrures that are not turrets.\nHowever, it can be applied against structures that are not turrets.(bug)\nThe reduction of damage against structures includes Sion's attacks as well as on-hit effects that can be applied to structures, such as  Demolish,  Titanic Hydra and the magic damage based on AP conversion based on  adaptive force.\nIt even includes  true damage from sources such as  Elixir of Sorcery.(bug)\nSion, during Glory in Death, will not lose health while being carried by  Fate's Call.\nGlory in Death does not trigger on clones of Sion, such as with  Test of Spirit.\nGlory in Death's  untargetability from the  stasis does not  destroy in-flight  projectiles.\nProjectiles created while Sion is in the zombie form will still travel to him even after he dies.\nUpon death, the current cooldowns of Sion's summoner spells are increased to 4 seconds. Afterwards, he is still unable to use them until he respawns.\nHowever, it is possible for another lock-out effect to unlock them when their duration ends (excluding  crowd control with the exception of  stasis).\nAfter Glory in Death ends, the corpse of Sion will retain unit collision despite being dead on the ground.\nBuffs from jungle monsters that Sion acquired during Glory in Death will not be lost when the duration ends. ( Crest of Cinders,  Crest of Insight)\nInteractions & Other\n\nBy surviving for the full duration of 60 seconds, Sion will have suffered 41.8k \u2212 443.7k (based on level) in health costs.\nSion can also heal from  spell vamp, althought the stat is currently unobtainable and it would be also unusable during Glory in Death, since there would be no available abilities that would apply it.\nEven though its visuals are present,  Dark Harvest can never be gained from Sion under the effect of Glory in Death.\nAt the start of Glory in Death, Sion's  mana drops to 0, but his  mana regeneration will remain in effect.\nZombie info\nZombie states trigger upon taking  lethal damage.\n Raw damage effects will not prevent zombie states from triggering.\nAll  resurrection effects will take precedence over effects that reanimate as a zombie.\nA champion that enters a zombie state will start their death timer upon triggering the effect.\nMost buffs and debuffs will be lost upon transitioning into a zombie state.\nThose that persist through death, such as  Brand's  Blaze, will remain.\nUndisplayed marker buffs, such as those imposed by  Veigar's  Event Horizon and  Viktor's  Gravity Field to prevent being affected multiple times by the same effect, will be lost.(bug)\nThis does not apply when transitioning from one zombie state to another zombie state.(bug)\nUnits within a zombie state cannot:\nUse  Recall or  Corrupting Potion /  Refillable Potion.\nActivate  resurrection effects.\nTake  Dark Passage, Catapult, or gates.\nPick up the  Eye of the Herald.\nBe targeted by the following:\n Bailout\n Chronoshift\n Umbral Trespass.\nBe affected by the following:\n Curse of the Black Mist\n Fear Beyond Death's chain missile\n Test of Spirit's initial missile\n Lamb's Respite\n Realm of Death\nFountain health restore",

There is no other difference between normal cast and quick cast for this ability, either.\nThe initial cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as  Spellblade.\nThe recast does not.\nAn enemy can only be affected by Unstoppable Onslaught once every 1 second.\nAfter reaching maximum damage and stun duration (at 3 seconds) Sion will transition from using his haste animation to his unique charging one.\nReaching the threshold on  Mecha Zero Sion changes his particle effects instead, most notably the 'Boosters' behind the vehicle.\nThe turning angle is not based on time and can easily be seen in practice when a Sion charges in-place due to bugs.\nSion's movement speed gains during the charge are unaffected by movement speed caps. Effects that would increase or decrease his movement speed do not affect him as well.\n Nami's  Surging Tides is the only known effect that can affect Sion's movement speed during the charge and that can place him above the normal MS value. However, without further multipliers, surpassing the 950 movement speed cap will require  Nami to have over 2150 ability power.\nSion does not always crash with terrain immediately upon touching it, enabling the player to turn beyond his maximum turning angle.\nCasting the ability at point blank of a terrain will most often automatically change the charge's direction.\nThis is not usually possible with player-generated terrain.\nUnstoppable Onslaught cannot charge through but can leap over player-generated terrain.\nSion loses the  crowd control immunity after finishing the  leap.\nSion is not immune to an allied  Bard's  Tempered Fate if it hits Sion during the 0.05-second delay before he starts the channel, he will not resist the effect and will initiate the slam immediately while in  stasis.(bug)\nUnstoppable Onslaught cannot strike the same non-champion twice in less than 1 second.\nEven though the cooldown of Unstoppable Onslaught starts at the end of the effect, gaining or losing ability haste, or upgrading the ability during the effect, will not change the resuming cooldown.\n Removing the  airborne before 0.5 seconds will not prevent the  stun from being applied.\n Displacement immunity will also resist the application of the  stun.\nSion can occasionally cast Unstoppable Onslaught while  rooted. In this case, he will stand in place until the root's debuff duration ends. During this time, the damage, stun duration and movement speed granted by the ability will still ramp up, and enemies that come into contact with him will be affected by the collision normally.(bug)\nA similar case allows him to cast it during crowd control that would disable it. However, the channel would be interrupted almost immediately, and he will initiate the leap as well.\n Fate's Call deferment of Unstoppable Onslaught will still allow Sion to leap forward at the end of the channel.\nMoving the cursor onto HUD elements (e.g mini map / champion portraits) does not jeopardize the cast and steering of Unstoppable Onslaught. The targeting will act as if the ground was targeted below the display element.\n PENDING FOR TEST: The distance between Sion's center and the center of the ground slam scales slightly with movement speed. This is suspected because running into a wall within half a second of charge time after starting at multiple thousands of movement speed shows a considerable difference, however this could also be due to a bug.\n PENDING FOR TEST: The leap appears to always have the same speed regardless of Sion's, at roughly 750.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Sion is  channeling:\n\n\nType\n\nChannel\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Soul Furnace and its  recast are usable.  Decimating Smash and  Roar of the Slayer are disabled. This ability recasts to end channel.\n\n\nMovement\n\nAllowed, but cannot input movement commands.\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite  Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash  Mark  Dash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath\n\nIf Unstoppable Onslaught's channel is interrupted despite the immunity to crowd control or  Decimating Smash is cast within 0.25 seconds after starting the charge, it will also initiate the leap. If the channel ends due to collision or death, there is no  leap and the effect occurs immediately.",

          "notes": "Petricite Burst's stack from casting Hijack is given after Sylas receives the Hijacked ability.\nHijack's per target cooldown is indicated by a ring under recently targetted enemy champions, and is only visible to Sylas and each individual enemy.\nIf Sylas casts Hijack on a  clone, no ultimate is stolen and the ability will be placed on full cooldown.\nThe same does not occur for champions within a  zombie state.\n Clones do not copy Hijack's target cooldown indicator, potentially revealing them to Sylas.\n Neeko's  Inherent Glamour does not hide her personal cooldown indicator, nor does she copy her allies'.\nIf the target becomes  untargetable,  dies, or is too far away or no longer in  sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on  cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).\n\n\nIf the same happens when casting an on-target stolen ability, the ability will instead cancel and go on cooldown.\nIf Hijack is intercepted by  Braum's  Unbreakable, Sylas will gain a copy of  Glacial Fissure instead and an on-target cooldown will be applied to him.\nIf  Braum has an on-target cooldown on him (by being previously Hijacked) upon interception, no ultimate will be stolen.\nSince the copied ability scales based on Hijack's rank, abilities can be copied regardless of their rank.\nHijack will copy all components of the ability: their passives and actives as well as recast effects. Hijack will not trigger the effects of other abilities unless absolutely necessary.\nShape-shifting ultimates will transform Sylas into the target's alternate form, replacing his basic abilities and base stats. Namely:  Cougar Form,  Spider Form,  Cannon Form and  Dragon Form.\nDragon's Descent transforms Sylas'  mana, into Shyvana's  fury, being able to replenishing it by basic attacking. At the end of the effect, Sylas gains his previous mana.\nDragon's Descent does not refresh ability cooldowns upon transforming.\nSpider Form freezes Sylas' original cooldowns on their current values, causing them to not come off cooldown during Spider Form. (bug)\nUpon transforming back from  Cannon Form, Sylas' next basic attack deals  Transform Mercury Hammer's bonus magic damage and uses his critical strike animation.\nTransforming into  Cannon Form with more than 2 stacks of Unshackled and then casting  Hypercharge will limit its effect until the currently held Unshackled stacks are spent. (bug)\nTransforming into Cougar Form with more than 2 stacks of Unshackled and then casting  Takedown will disable Takedown's effect until the buff timer runs out. (bug)\nPermanent transformations last for ~5 minutes or until toggled off.\nThe alternate abilities of transforming champions will cost mana and scale with the ranks as appropriate for the ability (e.g. ranks in R for Nidalee and ranks in Q/W/E for Jayce/Elise).\nUpon transforming, a  Petricite Burst stack will be deducted.\n Petricite Burst stacks will still be gained from abilities cast in alternate forms, but the stacks are gained independently from the normal ones.\nIf Sylas has both normal and transformed stacks, Petricite Burst will prioritize consuming Sylas stacks before the transformed ones.\nUltimates comply with  One for All rules if an ally is playing the hijacked champion. For example, an allied  Darius'  Hemorrhage stacks will increase the damage of the hijacked  Noxian Guillotine; or an allied  Syndra's  Dark Sphere will add extra damage to hijacked  Unleashed Power as well as producing 3 spheres that she can use.\nUltimate Interactions\n Ahri's  Spirit Rush - Does not gain  Essence Theft's takedown effect thus cannot grant additional recasts.\n Akshan's  Comeuppance - Sylas can cast  Abscond, but doing so ends the channel prematurely. If Comeuppance is cast after  Abduct but before the chains hit a target, Sylas isn't pulled to the target and the channel continues as usual.\n Amumu's  Curse of the Sad Mummy - Does not apply  Cursed Touch.\n Aphelios'  Moonlight Vigil - Based on the  main weapon at the moment of steal.\n Crescendum empowers his basic attacks temporarily.\n Calibrum does not apply marks.\n Severum grants a shield if healed while at full health.\n Ashe's  Enchanted Crystal Arrow - Does not apply  Frost Shot to secondary targets.\n Brand's  Pyroclasm - Does not apply stacks of  Blaze.\n Cho'Gath's  Feast - Gains permanent Feast stacks on-kill.\n Corki's  Missile Barrage - Gains max charges.\n Darius'  Noxian Guillotine - Does not apply a stack of  Hemorrhage. Upon gaining a reset from a Rank 3 Noxian Guillotine, Sylas can hold onto the ability for up to 300 seconds.\n Fiora's  Grand Challenge - Gains movement speed in the effect and can trigger the area healing, but  Vitals do not deal bonus damage.\n Galio's  Hero's Entrance - Gives Sylas and allies  Shield of Durand's magic  shield, based on  Kingslayer rank.\n Gangplank's  Cannon Barrage - Does not steal cannon upgrades.\n Gnar's  GNAR! - Gains a usable ultimate regardless of cast on  Mini Gnar or  Mega Gnar.\n Gwen's  Needlework - Does not apply  Thousand Cuts.\n Heimerdinger's  UPGRADE!!! - Sylas's basic abilities are replaced with Heimerdinger's empowered abilities. The upgrade buff lasts until the ultimate can be stolen again.\n Illaoi's  Leap of Faith - Does not reduce  cooldown of  Kingslayer.\n Irelia's  Vanguard's Edge - Applies marks of  Bladesurge.\n Jax's  Grandmaster-At-Arms - Applies magic damage on-hit while holding onto Grandmaster's Might, this effect is lost upon activation.\n Kassadin's  Riftwalk - Only provides one use.\n Kai'Sa's  Killer Instinct - Sylas' basic attacks,  Abduct and nearby allies'  immobilizations apply stacks of  Plasma, up to 4. Sylas is unable to apply the 5th stack necessary to expunge the stacks.\n Kalista's  Fate's Call - Only castable with a  link (purchasable in the Shop for  0 gold).\n Karma's  Mantra - Sylas' basic abilities are replaced with Karma's empowered abilities, according to Sylas' own ability ranks (including Hijack for Mantra bonuses).\n Katarina's  Death Lotus - Can be cast without a target.\n Kayn's  Umbral Trespass - Based on current form ( Shadow Assassin /  Rhaast).\n Kha'Zix's  Void Assault - Can steal the ability's  evolution bonus effects.\n Kennen's  Slicing Maelstrom - Applies  Mark of the Storm.\n Kled's  Chaaaaaaaarge!!! - Does not need  mount to cast.\n Kog'Maw's  Living Artillery - Only provides one use.\n LeBlanc's  Mimic - Uses the empowered version of  LeBlanc's last cast basic ability.  Mimic Sigil of Malice does not apply its mark. If she has not cast any abilities,  Mimic Sigil of Malice is copied.\n Leona's  Solar Flare - Does not apply  Sunlight.\n Lillia's  Lilting Lullaby - Sylas' abilities apply  Dream-Laden Bough's debuff, which does not deal its damage over time.\n Lucian's  The Culling - Can cast  Abscond and  Abduct freely during the channel.\n Lux's  Final Spark - Does not apply  Illumination.\n Master Yi's  Highlander -  Takedowns reduce basic ability cooldowns while holding onto Highlander, this effect is lost upon activation.\n Mordekaiser's  Realm of Death - Can join the dimension of outgoing realms if cast in the proper range (does not extend their duration).\n Nasus'  Fury of the Sands - Does not reduce  cooldown of  Chain Lash.\n Neeko's  Inherent Glamour - Always steals  Pop Blossom, regardless of the champion Neeko is disguised as.\n Olaf's  Ragnarok - Does not grant AD based on Sylas' AP, despite the tooltip indicating so.\n Orianna's  Command: Shockwave - Cast on self without a  Ball.\n Pantheon's  Grand Starfall - The spear deals damage based on  Chain Lash rank and scales with 46% AP.\n Quinn's  Behind Enemy Lines - Does not cast  Skystrike upon attacking an enemy champion. It can be casted manually however.\n Rengar's  Thrill of the Hunt - Sylas will gain  Unseen Predator on his next attack.\n Renekton's  Dominus - Grants Sylas 20 mana on cast and then 5 mana per second (up to 75 total mana over the duration).\n Rek'Sai's  Void Rush - Sylas' attacks against enemy champions will apply a  mark which can be used to cast the ability.\n Riven's  Blade of the Exile - Grants AD based on Sylas' AP on cast and grants him 75 bonus attack range for his auto attacks aswell for  Chain Lash and  Kingslayer.\n Samira's  Inferno Trigger - Can use without a  Grade.\n Seraphine's  Encore - Allies do not gain  Notes.\n Shaco's  Hallucinate - Creates a Sylas Clone with  Backstab that also copies Sylas' stolen ultimate indicator.\n Shyvana's  Dragon's Descent - Has a 200 second base cooldown.\n Skarner's  Impale - Can freely cast abilities during the suppression, but cannot basic attack or  Flash.\n Sylas'  Hijack - Steals the ability that the enemy Sylas has stolen. Cannot be targeted if no ability has been stolen.\n Syndra's  Unleashed Power - Throws a minimum of 3  spheres, which are left on the ground afterwards and vanish after 6 seconds.\n Talon's  Shadow Assault - Does not apply  Blade's End.\n Tahm Kench's  Devour - Sylas' basic attacks apply  An Acquired Taste, allowing him to cast Devour on enemies.\n Teemo's  Noxious Trap - Gains max charges.\n Tristana's  Buster Shot - Always has 525 cast range as Sylas does not benefit from  Draw a Bead's per-level cast range increase.\n Twitch's  Spray and Pray - Gains 300 attack range and his attacks produce missiles that travel 850 range. These attacks are classified as  melee.\n Udyr - Steals  Wingborne Storm, and can recast to  Awaken it. Effects are based on Hijack's rank.\n Urgot's  Fear Beyond Death - Can cast  Kingslayer during the recast.\n Varus'  Chain of Corruption - Applies stacks of  Blight to targets hit that can be detonated by Sylas' other abilities, dealing damage based on  Kingslayer rank.\n Vayne's  Final Hour - Gains the AD and MS bonuses. Additionally, Sylas gains  invisibility when he casts  Chain Lash.\n Vel'Koz's  Life Form Disintegration Ray - Does not apply  Organic Deconstruction.\n Viego's  Sovereign's Domination - Always steals  Heartbreaker, regardless of the champion Viego is possessing.\n Viktor's  Chaos Storm - Can steal the ability's  evolution bonus effects.\n Xayah's  Featherstorm -  Feathers do not interact with an ally or enemy  Xayah.\n Yasuo's  Last Breath -  Critical strikes ignore 50% of the target's  bonus armor after activation.\n Yuumi's  Final Chapter - Can freely cast abilities during the channel.\n Zac's  Let's Bounce! - Cannot declare attacks nor use any abilities nor while bouncing. Sylas does not create  chunks.\n Zeri's  Lightning Crash - Can gain Overcharge's effects and refresh it on basic attacks (even without being charged) and abilities.\n Zed's  Death Mark -  Shadow does not mimic abilities but can be reactivated to  swap places.",

This should not be confused with [cast times].\nIf the cast started beforehand, both the damage and the heal occur even after Warwick's  death, or during  resurrection.\nIf the target dies prior to Warwick reaching them, Jaws of the Beast refunds its cooldown when tapped. The ability can be still held, however, Warwick is no longer eligible for the refund in this case.  Correction: The refund can occasionally fail. (bug)\nThe healing is calculated only from Jaws of the Beast's damage, while additional effects, such as on-hits, are not.\nWhile the bite always occurs after the same delay, the time spent lunging does not, which depends on the range Jaws of the Beast was cast away from the target, up to 0.5 seconds when cast at maximum range.\nThis does not affect the  lockout timer, which is the same as the bite's delay.\nThe lunge always places Warwick to his attack range to the center of his target, while the dash will place him up to the edge of his attack range from the target's edge.\nIt has been special cased so Warwick does not follow an enemy's  Recall or a  Sion that revives from  Glory in Death.Correction: This may occasionally fail. Also note that as of currently, if Warwick manages to bite the target in those conditions, he will almost always end up following them to their base. (bug)\nJaws of the Beast's channel cannot be initiated while  grounded or  rooted. Warwick can only use the normal cast.\nThe channel will not be interrupted by either of the two effects, despite the lock-on being a movement channel.\nInteractions & Other\n\nIn order to hit the cap, the target monster needs to have at least 1667 / 1786 / 1875 / 1945 / 2000 health.\nJaws of the Beast is the only ability in the game that combines  channeling with  displacement immunity. Every  interrupting crowd control effect that is not resisted by the displacement immunity will prematurely stop the  dash.\nThe bite can still occur if cast before the crowd control application, but Warwick cannot start channeling.\nAbilities that apply both  stun and  airborne at the same time cause Warwick to ignore the displacement, but prematurely stop the channel and the dash.\nThe only exception to this is  Sion's  Glory in Death.\nWarwick will follow enemies that move via  attachment effects but the lock-on will not be extended.\nWhile Jaws of the Beast does not use Quick Casting by default, click-and-hold is comparable to the input required to use  Bone Skewer or  Comet Spear. It does not accept two-click input (e.g. First Cast and Recast) that abilities like  Piercing Arrow or  Decimating Smash use in Standard Casting.\nWarwick will attempt to basic attack the target after a short delay.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Warwick is  channeling:\n\n\nType\n\nCharge channel\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Primal Howl is usable.

If Yasuo becomes unable to cast abilities during the dash after buffering, Steel Tempest will not cast, but will still go on cooldown.(bug)\nThe one Gathering Storm stack is named Steel Wind Rising.\nThe whirlwind from consuming stacks of Gathering Storm can strike targets whose center is behind Yasuo, unlike most missiles.\nThe whirlwind is not released when cast during  Sweeping Blade, but instead  knocks up all enemies hit around Yasuo at the end of the dash for the same duration.\nSteel Tempest applies  basic damage to the first (closest) enemy hit and  area damage to secondary enemies:\nSteel Tempest will apply  on-hit effects to the first target hit, but will not do so to the secondary ones.\nSteel Tempest will not apply spell effects to the first target hit, but will do so to the secondary ones.\n Spell vamp will only grant  healing from the damage dealt to secondary targets, and healing is reduced to 33% effectiveness, accordingly.\n Life steal will heal based on the damage dealt to the first target hit.\nThe whirlwind is a missile and can therefore be  intercepted.\nSteel Tempest will only draw minion aggro if the first target is a champion.\nThis ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.\nEach parry has different interactions with this ability, whether it's the first target of Steel Tempest or the secondary one. In either case Yasuo still gains a stack of Gathering Storm and his whirlwind knock-up cannot be negated by parries:\n Dodge: both first target and secondary target do not take damage.\n Block: first target does not take damage, secondary target does take damage.\n Blind: both first target and secondary target do take damage.\nSteel Tempest rolls its  critical strikes individually against each enemy hit.\nCasting  Last Breath during Steel Tempest will buffer it to cast after the cast time has completed.\nHowever, if  Last Breath is used on a target affected by an  airborne source that is not Yasuo, it is cast immediately due to Steel Tempest's cast time ending prematurely. Steel Tempest will still cast in this case.\nIf Steel Tempest is buffered during Sweeping Blade and Yasuo uses  Recall,  Teleport or  Hextech Rocketbelt, Steel Tempest will go on cooldown without casting. In Protobelt's case Yasuo will also need to cast a movement command after it, else Steel Tempest will still trigger.\n Spell shield does not prevent a stack of Gathering Storm from being gained.\nWhile at two stacks, a range indicator will be shown for the effective range of the whirlwind.",
