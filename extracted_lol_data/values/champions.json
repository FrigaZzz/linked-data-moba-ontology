Now, the formula reduces the expected critical damage slightly by -2.5% AD, which is 10% of the reduction in base critical damage from Pre-Season 11.\nThe empowered attack will not trigger against structures nor wards.\nBasic attacks against them will still grant the cooldown reduction.\n PENDING FOR TEST:: Umbral Blade's interaction with parrying effects ( dodge,  block,  blind).",

The following do not consume Brittle but benefit from the reduction:  blinds,  cripples,  disarms,  grounding,  silences, and  slows.\nCrowd control effects that are unaffected by Tenacity do not benefit from the reduction at all, which are  airborne,  drowsy,  nearsight,  stasis, and  suppression.\nAlthough  airborne effects won't last 30% longer, if the spell simultaneously  stuns the target, this stun will be extended and persist past the airborne duration, for an overall increased crowd control duration.\n Ornn's  Searing Charge and  Call of the Forge God each apply both airborne and stun simultaneously for the same duration for this reason.\nLiving Forge's increase in bonus health  stacks multiplicatively with  Vigilant Wardstone's Blessing of Ixtal.\nIt is not required to rank  Bellows Breath in order to apply Brittle.\nThe bonus magic damage inflicted by Brittle is credited to Ornn.\nThe magic damage benefits from Ornn's  magic penetration.\nMastercraft items and their components are not the same item and so in theory any unnamed passives would stack and any unnamed actives would only put themselves on cooldown upon activated.

Because of this, it is possible to inflict differing amounts of damage if Master Yi's AD changes between marks.\nMaster Yi will follow all his primary target's movements.\nAlpha Strike can only follow up-to 2000 units; If the target teleports a very long distance, it will not be followed.\nIf the primary target becomes  untargetable and there are no other nearby valid targets, Alpha Strike will end prematurely and will not deal the damage occurring after Master Yi's reappearance.\nThe choice of exit direction occurs through an indicator anchored to the target during the time that Master Yi is vanished. Selection commands (default: MB1/left click) and movement commands (default: MB2/right click) are both valid.\nMultiple commands can be issued, but only the final command before exiting will determine the direction.\nIf the primary target is a champion, Master Yi will be automatically ordered to basic attack them after Alpha Strike ends.\nMaster Yi will not be able to buffer other abilities.(bug)\n Spell shield will only block a single instance of damage.\nOn-hit damage applied by Alpha Strike will be negated by  dodge and  block, but not while Master Yi is  blinded.\nAlpha Strike's own damage will not be negated.\nIf Master Yi  dies during Alpha Strike and he is only focusing one target, the ability will only deal the reduced damage strikes and not the final tick of damage from reappearing.\nIf he is striking multiple targets the damage will be dealt immediately when dying, and if he dies before the bounce from the last target, Alpha Strike will deal reduced damage only to all units he already bounced from.(bug)\nIf Master Yi enters  resurrection during Alpha Strike and he is only focusing one target, the ability will deal the reduced damage strikes as normal and the final tick of damage after being resurrected.\nIf he is striking multiple targets, Alpha Strike will sometimes deal the reduced damage from repeated bounces and the main damage after being resurrected, and sometimes only the reduced damage, unrelated to the number of targets available.(bug)\nThe following table refers for interactions while Master Yi is performing Alpha Strike:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Wuju Style and  Highlander are usable.

        "Details\nThis ability has a cast time and cast delay. The former represents the amount of time Kayle needs to spend to cast and is equal to her attack windup time. The latter is the amount of time the portal needs to launch the sword, which is always 0.264 seconds seconds, starting from the beginning of the cast time.\nAs implied by the previous point, the portal is created at the start of the cast time and Kayle does not have to be alive for it to launch the sword.\nThe portal does not follow Kayle's movements, using  Flash or getting displaced won't change its position nor direction either.\nThe cast time can be calculated by dividing Kayle's windup percent value (0.193555) with her current total attack speed.\nRadiant Blast's cast time is 0.33 seconds at base attack speed, is at most 0.99 seconds at the minimum attack speed of  0.2, and is 0.099 seconds at the attack speed cap of  2.5. The cast time can be further decreased with effects that allows the player to bypass the attack speed cap, such as  Lethal Tempo,\nAdditionally, it should be noted that due to action only taking place on whole game ticks, the cast time can only be changed in fractions of 0.033 seconds. This also means that the lowest possible cast time is 0.033 seconds, requiring at least  5.8652 attack speed.\nCorrection: Important to note that in patch V9.17, Radiant Blast's cast time was changed to be a flat 0.25 seconds, rather than scaling with the attack windup time. In patch V10.4, this was undocumentedly changed back. Whether the change to scale with windup time again was intentional or not is unknown.\nThe resistance reduction is applied after the damage has been dealt.\nThe expansion consist of 5 hitboxes, forming a cross-like shape centered 100 units ahead from the impact in its direction. Their technical details can be seen below and visualized on the image to the right.      The left side shows projectile's width and the total area traveled if it does not hit a target, while the right side shows the explosions when it hits a target.  \nExplosionCenter: 100 radius\nExplosionLeft: 150 distance, 125 width\nExplosionRight: 150 distance, 125 width\nExplosionBackward: 100 distance, 90 width\nExplosionForward: 400 distance, 90 width\nInteractions & Other\n\nThe visual effects of the explosion shows the blade and guard of Kayle's swords.\nThe resistance reduction can be tracked on the HUD as a debuff called Sundered and has a special icon that can be seen below.\nCorrection: Note that the  PsyOps skin still uses the old shred VFX, which also only shows for 3 seconds (effect duration is not affected).

The ability can be still held, however, Warwick is no longer eligible for the refund in this case.  Correction: The refund can occasionally fail. (bug)\nThe healing is calculated only from Jaws of the Beast's damage, while additional effects, such as on-hits, are not.\nWhile the bite always occurs after the same delay, the time spent lunging does not, which depends on the range Jaws of the Beast was cast away from the target, up to 0.5 seconds when cast at maximum range.\nThis does not affect the  lockout timer, which is the same as the bite's delay.\nThe lunge always places Warwick to his attack range to the center of his target, while the dash will place him up to the edge of his attack range from the target's edge.\nIt has been special cased so Warwick does not follow an enemy's  Recall or a  Sion that revives from  Glory in Death.Correction: This may occasionally fail.

        "Spirits are classified as  clones:\nSpirits can only be fully targeted by Illaoi's team and neutral monsters. The Spirit's allies cannot manually select it as a valid target for spells and abilities, but they can still do so with automatically targetted effects. (bug)\nSpirits take 50% damage from turrets and do not cause turrets to  Warm Up their attacks. (bug)\nSpirits cannot be  healed nor  shielded ( Summon Aery excluded (bug)).\nThe Spirit levels up when the Vessel does, gaining the target's stats per level. If the target has a resource that also increases per level (i.e  mana), the Spirit's lifetime will increase instead. (bug)\nThe Spirit's destination is decided based on Illaoi's position and facing direction when the target is hit.\nThe Spirit is  untargetable while it is being pulled, and spawns with the tethered champion's default model and size.\nThe Spirit's lifetime is sometimes 0.25 seconds longer, while its untargetability is sometimes shorter, causing Tentacles to hit an inconsistent amount of times.\nRedirected damage is calculated by taking the pre-mitigation damage against the Spirit, applying Test of Spirit's damage modifier, and then capping it to the Spirit's current health. This damage will then be affected by damage modifiers (resistances and other effects) of the Vessel.\nThis order of operations allows Test of Spirit to deal more or less percentage of the Vessel's health than would be expected:\nBecause the Spirit's modifiers can be different from the Vessel's, and the damage being pre-mitigated, allowing the Spirit to have higher or lower effective health, respectively increasing or decreasing the maximum achievable damage from killing it.\nBecause the cap is supposed to block excess damage over the Spirit's current health, which does not reliably do so or does too well, depending on whether the Spirit's damage modifier is higher than Test of Spirit's or not, respectively. This causes an increasing difference of damage when the pre-mitigated damage is between Spirit current health ÷ Spiritmod and Spirit current health ÷ Emod. (bug)\nTo fix this case, pre-mitigated damage would need to be capped at the amount that kills the Spirit, and only then have Test of Spirit's damage modifier apply.\nIllaoi needs 937.5 / 875 / 812.5 / 750 / 687.5 total AD to reach 100% redirected damage. As per above, the damage is still dependent on the Spirit's and Vessel's damage modifiers and may not always be able to deal 100% of the target's current health as total redirected damage.\n Spell shields may only prevent the initial spirit grab and the slow upon becoming a Vessel. Spell shields will not prevent becoming a Vessel or Tentacles from attacking.\nThe tendril can be blocked by abilities such as  Yasuo's  Wind Wall, but the returning tether slow cannot, even if it can otherwise be  destroyed by effects that can do so (i.e  untargetability).\nThe tether slow will not be fired if the target is already  untargetable when the Spirit dies.\nThe spirit pull is not considered a  crowd control effect and will not be blocked by  crowd control immunity, with the exception of  Morgana's  Black Shield.(bug)\nThe projectile tentacle model is linked to Illaoi's model animation and size. However gameplay wise it is not, thus the actual hitbox being different than the position, width and length of the visible model. (bug)\nThe model will stop mid-air / vanish if Illaoi goes into  stasis,  sleep or  airborne, however the actual hitbox will continue its trajectory unseen.\n PENDING FOR TEST: The projectile is however seen by enemies if Illaoi is not  visible.\nThis ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.\nAnd will fire towards the same pointed location.\nGrabbing the Spirit of a champion before it goes into  resurrection via  Chronoshift or  Guardian Angel will spawn the Spirit with 0 health, making it  invulnerable. (bug)\nThe same does not happen with other resurrection effects (i.e  Karthus'  Death Defied) since they leave the champion with more than 0 health.\nGrabbing the Spirit of a champion with  Flow or  Ferocity will make the Spirit's lifetime (the white bar below the lifebar) disappear. (bug)\n PENDING FOR TEST: Grabbing the Spirit of an  Oathsworn will make the Spirit invisible. (bug)\nIllaoi is the only one able to see who's been Vesseled, by adding a layer of watery effects on their model. The Vessel will also be let known it's debuffed, by having a layer of watery effects on its screen instead.\nIf the target becomes a Vessel while  vanished, the layer on their model will fail to be added. (bug)\nThe Vessel status effect is a debuff that doesn't persist through death.\nIf the target is made a Vessel while  resurrecting, they will not revive as a Vessel.\nRunes consider the Spirit as a champion for their effects and stat-tracking. (bug)\nTentacles damage with  First Strike only reflects double bonus damage, not taking into account actual damage done to the Spirit (e.g if  First Strike would deal 3 bonus damage, what would get reflected is 6 damage). (bug)\nTransferred damage will apply on-damage effects, such as  Black Cleaver,  Morellonomicon,  Executioner's Calling,  Riftmaker,  Aspect of the Dragon burn damage.\nRedirected damage always counts as single target for the purpose of  Omnivamp.\nThe Spirit will also redirect the bonus damage dealt by Riftmaker and Aspect of the Dragon, effectively double diping their damage to the Vessel. In particular, Riftmaker also further increases its own redirected damage, granting an additional 0.81% bonus damage at full stacks, for a total of 18.81%.\nTransferred damage will not doubly apply on-hit or on-spell effects versus the target (e.g.  Liandry's Anguish,  Phase Rush stacks). These effects are only applied versus the Spirit.\nAttacking the Vessel and its Spirit simultaneously will only apply one stack of  Black Cleaver to the Vessel. (bug)\nWhen the tether is broken (whether the Spirit's lifetime ran out or the target moved out of range), the Spirit will  vanish and move to Illaoi's location.\nAn  uncancellable windup attack may still kill the Spirit after it vanished to grant the gold, but without making the target a Vessel.\nThe Spirit is immune to  stasis (i.e.  Bard's  Tempered Fate).\n Fiora's  Riposte can be used to prevent becoming a Vessel if used before the Spirit is killed or while leaving the tether's range.\n Sion's Spirit cannot be spawned during  Glory in Death. Spirits created before Sion's  zombie state will remain active.\nIf the target that had its Spirit pulled from them is taken into the  Realm of Death, the tether will break, but they will not be made into a Vessel.\nIf Illaoi has  Crown of the Shattered Queen's Safeguard, the Spirit will gain Safeguard's effects.(bug)\nThe following table refers for interactions while Illaoi is firing the projectile and while the target's Spirit is being pulled:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Tentacle Smash and  Leap of Faith are buffered.

In this case, he will stand in place until the root's debuff duration ends. During this time, the damage, stun duration and movement speed granted by the ability will still ramp up, and enemies that come into contact with him will be affected by the collision normally.(bug)\nA similar case allows him to cast it during crowd control that would disable it. However, the channel would be interrupted almost immediately, and he will initiate the leap as well.\n Fate's Call deferment of Unstoppable Onslaught will still allow Sion to leap forward at the end of the channel.\nMoving the cursor onto HUD elements (e.g mini map / champion portraits) does not jeopardize the cast and steering of Unstoppable Onslaught.

        "The extra distance that the bolts travel scales with bonus attack range.\nSpray and Pray allows Twitch to outrange  turrets by 50 units, allowing him to hit them without them returning fire.\nTwitch targets his line attack at his target's location at the start of his attack windup.\nThe bolts reach targets at a delay, composed of Twitch's windup time and distance the bolt has to travel at finite speed. Even the primary target can dodge the attack if they are moving quickly enough.\nThe bolt projectiles will naturally pass through terrain and enemy structures (the latter will be damaged by bolts even if they are not directly targeted).\nIf Twitch is  blinded before winding up the attack, the hits will miss against all targets.\n Runaan's Hurricane's Wind's Fury interacts with Spray and Pray's  bonus attack range but not with the modified missile effect (the secondary bolts will not have pass-through effects).\nWhenever the bolts penetrate a target, a small elongated cloud appears at the location, which's VFX and SFX can be seen and heard inside the Fog of War.\nThe bolts' travel distance scales with the full value of Twitch's  attack range increases such as  Rapid Firecannon, but not with size increases (which only increase his effective attack range, thereby the target range).\n(Outdated as of V10.13, now can hit everything with edge range, except for turrets) The  center of a unit must be within the maximum travel distance of the bolt missile, and in front of the spawn location (Twitch's  center) for the bolt to be able to hit them.\nOther than this condition, the bolt missile has to only touch (pass within its half width of 60 units) the  edge of the unit's radius.\nThis is standard behaviour for linear skillshots.",

        "Details\nDivine Judgment's cast time does not interrupt movement and the cast will finish even after Kayle's  death.\nSince  internalraw damage ignores invulnerability, the target may still die via the  Nexus Obelisk, but the ability will finish at their corpse's position regardless.\nDivine Judgment will prioritize casting on allies over Kayle. This means that if Kayle's and an ally's selection ranges are intercepting each other on the cursor's position, the cast will always occur on the ally.\nAs implied by the description, the invulnerability is granted at the beginning of the 1.5 seconds cast time, while the damage is dealt at the end.\nNote that the cast time and the invulnerability duration is independent from each other. Some players may confuse the cast finish as the end of the invulnerability, but the target will be still invulnerable for 0.5 / 0.75 / 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 more seconds.\nPrior to becoming Transcended via  Divine Ascent, casting Divine Judgment refreshes the duration of  Zeal stacks at the start of the cast time to ensure that it does not expire while she can't attack during the cast.\nDuring cast, an indicator for the damaging area can be seen around the target, however, this is not visible if there is no  sight on the them.\nDivine Judgment can be cast on  clones too, including  Shapesplitter and  Warrior Trickster, which are normally not targetable for allies.\nWhile it's uncommon occurence, it is possible to cast Divine Judgment on targets who just entered  resurrection or  zombie state. This is only possible with very strict timing and perhaps high latency.\nIt's recommended to avoid both of the afformentioned interactions, as they renders the usage of Divine Judgment useless in many cases.\nInteractions & Other\n\nWhile the target is invulnerable, a number indicator will appear beneath them whenever they would receive damage to show the amount that was entirely mitigated. This is calculated pre-mitigation, or before resistances and reductions are taken into account.\n Rapid Firecannon's Energized effect behaves strangely with the set basic attack range:\nIf the ability is cast while the effect is ready, the range goes from  400 to  385 over 4 stat updates (400 -> 390 -> 387 -> 385). When the cast completes, the proper range needs 2 updates to set in ( 660 -  675 while Arisen;  710 -  725 while Transcended).\nGaining the effect during the cast will cause the range to cycle between  525 and  550 until the cast finishes, then the proper range is set after 1 update.\nSelling the item during the cast causes the range to be set to  250.\n PENDING FOR TEST: Range values are outdated because of patch V11.18 changes to Kayle.\n\nThe invulnerability can be tracked on the HUD via a buff called  Intervention.",

These displacements do not apply  airborne and are not flagged as displacements, meaning that targets who are not  immune to the  suppression are also never immune to the displacement either.
